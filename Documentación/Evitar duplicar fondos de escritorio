I found that if you open the file and set it as your wallpaper through the Image Viewer, it won't make a copy.


I don't want my Pictures directory to have mixed photos, so I have manually created a directory with the name "Wallpapers". So, every time I set a wallpaper from there, I get a copy that I don't need. Moreover, the Wallpaper manager shows pictures only from the ~/Pictures directory (no subdirs), that I consider a bad practice, because I would get a bunch of irrelevant pictures there. I think that Ubuntu should either: 1. copy the wallpaper to a hidden directory 2. or/and allow to select a wallpaper from ~/Pictures/Wallpapers At least there should be a check for existence before copying! â€“
