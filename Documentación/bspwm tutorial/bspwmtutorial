# Now copy the bspwmrc / sxhkdrc files
mkdir ~/.config/bspwm && mkdir ~/.config/sxhkd



# Now lets check the bspwmrc file 

xrdb merge ~/.Xresources & # (termnal theme)


# Now copy my polybar folder ( from my repo ofc ) to your ~/.config folder or you can use the default polybar and configure it yourself.

# To use the default polybar config :
mkdir ~/.config/polybar (this will make polybar folder) 



# If you used my polybar config then , simply add this in your bspwmrc : ~/.config/polybar/launch.sh

My polybar config has two files : config and launch.sh . the config file has all the modules , fonts etc stuffs and the launch.sh file just reads the polybar barname from the config file and runs it .

# If some fonts on polybar ( my config ) dont work then probably you need to install fontawesome5 fonts and fonts used by my polybar. Just put all the files from my font repo to your ~/.local/share/fonts folder and then do : fc-cache -fv . If there's no fonts folder then create it ! .

# If the wifi module doesnt work on the polybar then check your wlan interface's name ( type iwconfig to know it ) and replace it with mine under config .
